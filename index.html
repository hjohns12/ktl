    <h1>NYC Kitchen Tool Library</h1>
    <div class="section">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Kitchen Tool Library (KTL) creates a structure for people to loan and borrow cooking tools from each other in New York City. There is  not enough space, 
    money, or ecological capacity for every person to own their own kitchen tools and appliances. By loaning and borrowing tools from one another, we practice 
    resource-sharing, degrowth, and mutual care-taking. </p>
    <p>
    KTL envisions a future where we don’t need to continuously produce and consume in order to get what we want to thrive. This library stems from the belief 
    that every person should have access to the ingredients and tools necessary to make delicious, nourishing food. KTL endorses efforts to collectively hold more 
    resources, and view the Kitchen Tool Library as one way to practice living the abolitionist future of our dreams. If you have a tool to offer or are in need of 
    one, KTL hopes to support the culinary needs of the community.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>
    People choose whether they want to loan a tool, borrow a tool, or do both. </p>
    <p>
    The term “kitchen tool” is broad-spanning and encompasses anything used to make food. This includes things like a bowl, a grill, a pie dish, 
    an ice cream maker, a slotted spoon, a hotel pan, and a smoker. </p>
    <h3>Loaners</h3>
    <p>
    If someone is loaning a tool, they specify how long the loaning period will last for. If a tool is stationary (like a large smoker), 
    then a borrower would come to the loaners’ house to use it. 
  </p>
   <h3>Borrowers</h3> 
   <p>
    If someone is borrowing a tool, they will coordinate with the loaner to pick up and return the tool. Transportation is something we can help provide support with if need be. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Community agreements are in place, and everyone must consent to them before getting involved in the Kitchen Tool Library. These agreements are below:
  </p>
  <p>
    By participating in the kitchen tool library, I commit to:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Loan/borrow/return the tool within the agreed upon time frame.</li>
        <li>Take care of the tool. If you're a borrower, this means cleaning the tool after you finish using it, 
            and returning the tool in the same condition you got it.</li>
        <li>If the tool you're borrowing gets damaged, work with the person who it belongs to in order to figure out a way to fix/replace it.</li>
        <li>Communicate directly and clearly with the borrower/loaner if unforeseen things come up. </li>
      </ol>
